A complete, fully functional **FastAPI backend** for a Movie Ticket Booking System — built as the **Final Project** for the FastAPI Internship Training (Days 1–6).

This project covers all 6 days of FastAPI concepts — from basic GET endpoints to advanced search, sorting, pagination, multi-step workflows, and full CRUD operations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**CineStar** is a REST API backend that simulates a real-world movie ticket booking system. Users can:

- Browse available movies
- Filter movies by genre, language, price, and seats
- Search movies by keyword
- Book tickets with seat type selection
- Apply promo codes for discounts
- Hold seats temporarily and confirm or release them
- Add, update, and delete movies (admin operations)
- Sort and paginate through movies and bookings

| Day 2 | POST + Pydantic Models | `BookingRequest` with min_length, gt, le constraints. `NewMovie` model |

## 🎟️ Seat Types

| Seat Type | Price Multiplier |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `standard` | 1× base price |
| `premium` | 1.5× base price |
| `recliner` | 2× base price |

---

## 🏷️ Promo Codes

| Promo Code | Discount |
|------------|----------|
| `SAVE10` | 10% off total cost |
| `SAVE20` | 20% off total cost |

The API returns both `original_cost` and `total_cost` (after discount) in the booking response.

## 🎬 Sample Movie Dataset

The project comes pre-loaded with 8 movies:

| ID | Title | Genre | Language | Price | Seats |
|----|-------|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Inception | Action | English | 250 | 80 |
| 2 | The Dark Knight | Action | English | 300 | 60 |

---

## 🔁 Multi-Step Workflow (Day 5)

The seat-hold workflow connects 3 endpoints:

```
POST /seat-hold         →  Hold seats temporarily (reduces seats_available)
POST /seat-confirm/{id} →  Confirm hold → creates a real booking
DELETE /seat-release/{id} → Cancel hold → returns seats back to movie
```

---

## 🔍 Combined Browse Endpoint (Day 6)

`GET /movies/browse` supports all these optional parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `keyword` | None | Search in title, genre, language |
| `genre` | None | Filter by genre |
| `language` | None | Filter by language |
| `sort_by` | `ticket_price` | Sort field |
| `order` | `asc` | Sort direction |
| `page` | `1` | Page number |
| `limit` | `3` | Items per page |

**Order of operations:** keyword filter → genre/language filter → sort → paginate
